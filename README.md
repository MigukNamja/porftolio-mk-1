# First Decent-Looking Personal Website / Portfolio

## Purpose

Getting in some practice creating first portfolio.

## Content

This a basic portfolio with the following content:

- Hero page with fancy menu/nav behavior
- Resume page
- Contact page
- Work page

## Technology

- HTML5
- SASS (CSS3)
- JS (ES6)

A framework tool e.g. Vue, React, Angular, etc. was _not_ used.

## Credits

This was made by watching Brad Traversy's "Responsive Portfolio Website Project" and following along.

I watched and follow along a couple of times, both time starting from scratch so I develop muscle memory. I also paused if I didn't understand new syntax to go read up on it.

## Next

My next plan is to give a class (WebEx) on the concepts covered here to help me further cement the concepts and syntax.
