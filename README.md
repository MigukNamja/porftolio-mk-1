# First Decent-Looking Personal Website / Portfolio

## Purpose

Getting in some practice creating first portfolio.

## Content

This a basic portfolio with the following content:

- Hero page with fancy menu/nav behavior
- Resume page
- Contact page
- Work page

## Technology

- HTML5
- SASS (CSS3)
- JS (ES6)
- Visual Studio Code

A framework tool e.g. Vue, React, Angular, etc. was _not_ used. This was useful to get a better understanding of what vanilla JS and SASS can do and not rely on Bootstrap, Vuetify, Vuex, etc.

## Credits

This was made by watching Brad Traversy's "[Responsive Portfolio Website Project][video]" and following along.

I watched and followed along a couple of times, both times starting from scratch to develop muscle memory. I paused and read up on syntax, etc. if I didn't understand it.

## Next

My next plan is to give a class (WebEx) on the concepts covered here to help me further cement the concepts and syntax.
